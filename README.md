# RandomMover

Welcome to the Race Game! This C++ program simulates a fun and interactive race where you, the player, compete against randomness to reach the finish line. Below is a brief overview of how to play and what to expect from the game.

**How to Play:**

1. **Starting the Race:**
   - Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to enter a letter to represent yourself on the race track.
   - Choose your letter wisely as it will mark your position on the track throughout the race.

2. **Race Simulation:**
   - Once you've chosen your letter, the race begins!
   - You'll see the race track displayed on your screen, with your chosen letter indicating your current position.
   - Each turn, your position on the track will be updated randomly. You might move forward, stay in place, or even take a step back, all determined by chance.

3. **Race Outcome:**
   - The race continues until you either reach the finish line or fall behind.
   - If your position reaches the beginning of the track, you couldn't finish the race, and the game ends.
   - If your position reaches the end of the track, congratulations! You've successfully finished the race.

**Features:**

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Randomized movements for an unpredictable race experience.
- Easy-to-understand interface displaying the race track and your position.

**Dependencies:**

- This program requires a C++ compiler to build and run.
